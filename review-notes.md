# Review Notes

## Issue Found
- /sobre route shows 404 — App.tsx has route as "/sobre-dockly" but navbar links to "/sobre-dockly"
- Actually the navbar link IS "/sobre-dockly", so the URL I tested "/sobre" is wrong
- Need to test "/sobre-dockly" instead

## Pages Verified Working
- Home: hero, CTA, disclaimer, cards
- Areas: 10 departments with expandable cards, badges
- Proceso: 10-step timeline with dual columns
- Salarios: tables with salary ranges, notes
- Estafas: red flags, illegal charges, verification checklist
- Mitos: 7 myths with verdict badges

## Still need to verify
- /sobre-dockly
- /requisitos
